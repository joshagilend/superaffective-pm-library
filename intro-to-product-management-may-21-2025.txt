Intro To Product Management, May 21, 2025

As a product manager, your job is to direct the flow of engineering, product, and design to the goals of the business.

The #1 goal of a product manager should be guiding and directing the team. A product manager is always an Individual Contributor (IC).

As a product manager, when you deliver product, you're happy :) You've fulfilled your mission as a product manager to the company and the business, and fulfilled your promise to your team, your company's leadership, and your users :)

As a product manager, you report to the Group Product Manager who leads the overall mission of your team's group. Each group has one or several Group Product Managers who help product managers at all levels succeed. They are the leaders of the product managers in your organization.

Product management is always a collaborative effort - You'll work across disciplines in engineering, design, and business to solve problems for the company.

A product manager is always problem-solving, directing traffic, and "saving the day" for your favorite people: your engineers and designers.

Be generous with your time. Always have time for a product chat, a get-to-know-you call, or an impromptu coffee with a new friend :)

My best advice for product managers: Always be available - Always be working - And always have fun :)

Best,
